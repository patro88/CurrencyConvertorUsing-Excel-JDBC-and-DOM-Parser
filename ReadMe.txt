1) Here in this project I have created three layers : AppLayer , ServiceLayer and DataAccess Layer
2) Applayer contains the main menthod that invokes the required methods in ServiceLayer. 
3) ServiceLayer contains all the business Logic for the	application
4) Sercvice Layer calls Data Access layer to get the data.
5) Data Access layer contains logic to getdata from the datasource.
